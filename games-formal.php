        Your company is about to go bankrupt because too much money goes into paying your employees their wages.<br>
        You've therefore come to this conclusion:<br>
        You must kick everyone out<br>
        To kick people out, spin on them (walk and jump).<br>
        Watch out for falling/flying chairs, computers, desks and paper planes! If they it you, a delay will occur. (Paper planes does also reduce score by 100, but gives you shorter delay.)</p>
